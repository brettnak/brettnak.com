* What is Applied Mathematics?
  - A question ( well posed, think Mr. Miyagi )
  - A transformation ( Real world -> Math problem )
    - Simplify, Describe
  - Computation
    - The 'chore'
  - Math problem -> Results in the real world

* Math is not calculations!

* Edge cases
  - Estimations
  - Understanding limitations of calculations

* Paper dumbs math down!
  - Touchy.
  - Computers are better at keeping track of the 'hair'.
  - We've dumbed down problems for paper.
  - Programming ( not paper ) to check your understanding.

* Examples
  - Concepts of calculus are easy.
  - Calculations of calculus are hard.

* Exams are fawed.  No computers.
  - What is the best life insurance.

* The software industry is nowhere near this!
  - How do we get there?
  - The country who first grasps this will leap frog.
